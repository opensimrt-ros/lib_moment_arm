# TODO:

 - for the symbolic\_moment\arm script to work we need quite a bit of dependencies, so probably I want to at least have a requirements.txt file here, or this won't compile. 
 - the script is not being called by the CMakeLists.txt file, this has to be there somewhere
 - I need to generate a new library for each subject, which is troublesome. right now this is very hardcoded. Maybe I want to change the sym... script to at least accept the model as an argument
