# TODO:

 - for the symbolic\_moment\arm script to work we need quite a bit of dependencies, so probably I want to at least have a requirements.txt file here, or this won't compile. 
 - the CMakeLists.txt is a mess, I am hardcoding the paths for opensim and simbody please fix it
 - also, maybe we want to generate the graphs of the pdf thing and rsme values when we are generating the models, or at least expose this somehow, maybe people will want to look at it
